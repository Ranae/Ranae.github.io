							<h1>What will it take to restore organic matter to Iowa’s soils?</h1>
							<p>Iowa has some of the most organic-rich agricultural soils in the world, contributing to both high productivity and strong resiliency.  However, these soils have only about 50-70% of their original organic matter and many current agricultural practices are conducive to further organic matter loss.  Efforts have been made to begin restoration of organic matter, the most extreme among these being the reconstruction of native prairie.  A recent comparison of soil organic matter in reconstructed prairie to corn-based systems not only failed to show any increase in soil organic matter in the prairie soil, but a simulation of the systems over 50 years showed that both systems continuously lost soil organic matter.  While current soil organic matter decomposition theory supports these results, mathematical modeling plays a strong role in the simulation.   </p>
							<p>Each decomposition model is based upon a different hypothesis of decomposition, which in turn is based upon sets of experiments.  The simulation previously mentioned is based upon just one hypothesis of decomposition.  We propose running the same simulation situation with 55 of the most common decomposition models to test the results and examine the factors that may lead to different outcomes. We then propose using the same models to determine a value for organic matter input which results in an increase in soil organic matter in Iowa soils.  </p> 
							<p>The diversity of decomposition hypotheses comes from many different experiments, all of which share flaws brought about by manipulating soil, a medium which acts very differently when disturbed.  These experiments have all examined the three biggest factors controlling decomposition: temperature, moisture, and organic matter carbon and nitrogen content.  We propose to examine these same factors, but in undisturbed soil.  We will terminate subplots of prairie, creating a belowground pool of dead roots to function as organic matter, and then track the decomposition of this organic matter over three years.  The results of this experiment will be incorporated in the previously used models. </p>  
							<p>The results of the modeling and the measurements will be used to create an interactive, online tool where the user can manipulate temperature, moisture, organic matter quality, organic matter amount, and initial soil organic matter amount to see how these factors change the soil organic matter amount over time.  This engaging format is meant to instill a better understanding of how soil organic matter dynamics work.  Results of the study will also be published in farming and scientific publications. The most important outcome of the project will be recognition of how temporary Iowa’s soil organic matter is and how difficult it will be to restore it.  This will lead to a greater desire for preservation and begin a difficult dialogue on a potential future with soils lower in soil organic matter.</p>
