# Welcome  

# Who's here?

# Context

## World of R
* R was developed from S and introduced in 1996
* The creators thought it would be used by only a handful of people
* Now second most popular Data Science software (after SPSS)

## Base R
* Base R is what you get if you download only R  
* It runs all of your basic functions  
* Includes some of the earliest developments and changes very slowly
* Very stable and dependable 
* Built with code-familiar people in mind

## Packages  
* People put together R code to do specific tasks
* These packages must be installed and called on top of base R
* Packages include documentation and examples

## Tidyverse  
* A place where people and their mental well-being are valued  
* Welcoming to non-programmers  
* Seeks to be a utopia of data science  
* One of many R universes  

##Philosophy best explained by creator  

Hadley Wickham's talk from UseR! 2016 [Tools for tidy data](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Towards-a-grammar-of-interactive-graphics)  

<font size="22">If someone is making a "pit of success", you should probably walk towards it.</font>

## Best way to learn the tidyverse

 [A book about data science in the tidyverse](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
 
##What is it? 
Collection of R packages designed to work around a [common philosophy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html).

## R + RStudio  
* R is the engine  
* RStudio is a dashboard  
* We will install both, get into RStudio later  
* RStudio and the Tidyverse are best friends  

## R4DS  
* This book was written for scientists who want to get started driving the car without worrying about how the engine was built  
* This book avoids a lot of stats  
* In Tidyverse fashion, feedback on this book is appreciated so we can someday reach data science textbook utopia  
* Available for free online (it evolves) or you can buy a paperback on Amazon  

# Course Logistics  

## Syllabus  
* Each week you will read some of the book **on your own**.
* We will meet here as you work on the exercises included in the sections 
* We will help each other out  
* We will adjust our speed according to the class  
* I will provide additional exercises to push some of you  

## Course Objectives  
* Data Visualization  
* Exploratory Data Analysis  
* Basic Data Structures
* Workflows  
* Getting Comfortable with R  

## Assessment  
* Attendance  
* Participation  
* If you are not meeting expectations, I will let you know  
* We all have a common goal for you to learn, and I will remind you of your goal  

## Discourse  
* I have set up a "discussion community" on [Discourse](http://agron590rd.trydiscourse.com/)  
* Please post all questions here    
* Feel free to answer questions  
* Would be awesome if people post general observations and comments (aka, "discussion")
* If you need to miss a class, you will need to "attend" through this forum instead 

## To-do for next week  
* Install R and RStudio on your computer (or VM)  
* Read Sections 1-3.4 in R for Data Science  
* Post "Introduction" on Agron R4DS discourse forum
